# proccaendrexp: Process expression data generated by CaENDR
This repository contains the code used to download and process RNA-seq data generated by CaENDR (Zhang et al Nat Comms 2022).
Data processed using this code underpins the Shiny app https://wildworm.biosci.gatech.edu/cendrexp/

## Script details
- `downloadworkflow`: directory with nextflow workflow to use SRAToolkit to download the FASTQs, associated config, files used to run it
- `strainspectranscriptome`: directory with nextflow workflow that generates strain-specific salmon indexes. See also workflows in repo https://github.com/averydavisbell/wormstrainrnaiexpr/
- `strainspecsalmon`: directory with nextflow workflow running strain-specific salmon quantification. See also workflows in repo https://github.com/averydavisbell/wormstrainrnaiexpr/
- `cendrrnaseq2022paper_salm2vst.R`: goes from salmon quants to per-gene normalized quantifications.
Run with `--help` to see required inputs.
